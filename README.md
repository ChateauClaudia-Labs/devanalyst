# devtools

The `devtools` package provides support for data-driven analysis of a software development's team efficiency.
At present it provides support for:
- Simulation of a release cycle:
  - User story burndown

In the future it is planned to provide support as well for:
- Simulation of a release cycle:
  - Bug inflow
  - Source commits
- Efficiency metrics
  - Common model for the data inputs associated to a release cycle
  - Mathematical definition of efficiency metrics
- Data analysis
  - Ability to validate or refute efficiency hypothesis
  - Hotspotting to pin down inefficiency drivers in the code or the team
